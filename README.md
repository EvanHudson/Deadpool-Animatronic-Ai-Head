It is a animatronic talking deadpool head run on a raspberry pi 4 8gb ram that uses chatgpt for online and a quantized 7b model for offline chat completion. It uses google text to speech for online and a local llm for offline tts. In addition it implements multiple api's such as wolfram alpha, google smtp, etc.. for various functions like real time information based on loactaion from ip address. Plus, it will in the future use a camera for facial recognition and create/load the conversation history based on which facial match it recieves.
